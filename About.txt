1) Objective : To parse the HML (Human defined Markup Language)

2) HML have some defined format and user can enter the query in some defined format too.
Structure of HML & Query is defined as follows:

Input: 
------

8 4   
<tag1 name = "aakash">
<tag2 value = "cool">
<tag4 game = "on">
</tag4>
</tag2>
<tag3 msg = "good">
</tag3>
</tag1>
tag1.tag2~name
tag1.tag2~value
tag1.tag3~msg
tag1~name

Output: 
---------
Not Found!
cool
good
aakash

Explaining Syntax....
----------------------------


# 8 - No of lines containing HML.
# 5 - No of lines containing User Query.
Query Format:
# Two tags are separted by Dot "." only if they have parent child relationship Like tag1.tag2 (tag1 is Parent of Tag2).
# Tag and its Attribute are delimited by Tilde "~".


Explaining Output:
---------------------------

tag1.tag2~name   --  Not Found! (As there is no Tag2 containing name as attribute) 
tag1.tag2~value  ---   cool   (Tag1 have child tag2 and tag2 have attribute value)
tag1.tag3~msg --  good  (Tag1 have child tag3 and tag3 have attribute msg)
tag1~name --- aakash (Tag1 have attribute name)

3) How to run Program?

Just type "python parse.py" on your shell, condition python must be installed on your machine. NO Extra Library Required.
I tested on Python2.7.
