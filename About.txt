cool
good
aakash

Explaining Syntax....
----------------------------


# 8 - No of lines containing HML.
# 5 - No of lines containing User Query.
Query Format:
# Two tags are separted by Dot "." only if they have parent child relationship Like tag1.tag2 (tag1 is Parent of Tag2).
# Tag and its Attribute are delimited by Tilde "~".


Explaining Output:
---------------------------

tag1.tag2~name   --  Not Found! (As there is no Tag2 containing name as attribute) 
tag1.tag2~value  ---   cool   (Tag1 have child tag2 and tag2 have attribute value)
tag1.tag3~msg --  good  (Tag1 have child tag3 and tag3 have attribute msg)
tag1~name --- aakash (Tag1 have attribute name)
